        As the above image you are write a JavaScript program to take the text out of a paragraph tag and place it behind words longer than eight characters with a highlighted backdrop. Determining the beginning and end of a word in a string can be challenging due to various symbols, gaps, and other irregularities. However, since the rule was limited to terms with more than eight characters, we can take a more flexible approach.
